    I worked with the Systems Software Research group at Virginia Tech on the Popcorn Linux team.

    A core part of the Popcorn Linux project involves migrating processes (running instances of programs) between nodes. While the migration feature was working well, there wasn't an official test suite. As a result, it was hard to optimize the migration process. Hence, I developed regression tests for the migration feature. The tests are written in C and I automated running the tests using Python scripts.
    Additionally, I created a pipeline on CircleCI to automate testing kernel
    compilation for the supported architectures.
  used: [C, Python, CircleCI]

    The software engineering team was working on a game to teach computer

    science to high school students through visual programming.
    The game consisted of puzzles in which the user had to move their
    avatar to a destination on the level.

    I coded a backend module in Python to give hints to the player when
    they were stuck. I used the neo4j graph database to store solutions to
    levels. I worked remotely on the project since the engineering
    team was in Hong Kong.
  used: [Python, Neo4j]
